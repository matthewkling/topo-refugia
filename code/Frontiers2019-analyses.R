# 2019 Topoclimate paper for Frontiers

# Paper has four analyses
# 1) FIA climate-slope analyses



# 2) Mean topoclimate location of species from hyperspectral
# pwd_hyperspectral_topo_niche.R
# output: pwd_niche_means.csv

# Pepperwood gam modeling of topo distributions
# model fit: pwd-topo-gam-fit.R
# output: big_data/gam_fits.Rdata
# model evaluation: pwd-topo-gam-eval.R
# output: pwd_gam1.csv

# 3) species mean climate location
# regional_niche_models.R
# output: 

# 4) #2 vs. #3
# compare_pwd_regional.R
# output - figures
#

# 5) future suitability at pepperwood
# based on gam models and perturbation of PWD topoclimate surfaces


# based on local suitability extracted from regional models


# 6) 2,3 vs. 5
